## Eazy

Most of the "easy challenges" are indeed quite eazy.
we are using
   - generics
   - generics with optional params
   - generics with default params
   - generics
   - primitive types
   - union types
   - composed types
   - looping (key in keyof T)
   - optionals
   - required
   - readonly
   - inferring params
   - inferring return type
   - ternary conditional operator (condiditon ? TIfTrue : TIfFalse)
   - Spread Operator
   - T[number], T["length"], T[0]
   - extends (see basic concepts > extends.ts) & Distributive Conditional Types exception for generics (see conditionals.ts)
## medium
    - Same principles as above
    - [k in T as ***]-syntax
    - recursive generic functions
